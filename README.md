CONCEPT
The main idea is to design and develop a travelling planner which the user can use to prepare for a trip. 
This application let the users search for interesting sights including points of interest on the way to their destination. 
It is possible to personalise the plan of a trip according to the userâ€™s preferences. 
Moreover, it provides the user with sufficient information about the points of interest on the way to his destination. 
This information might include a short description, rating from other users of the system and
reviews. The application then plans the exact route from point A to B including the
selected stops and provide the navigation. 

Some of the additional features of the
applications might include the ability to save and edit the planned route. Furthermore,
a possibility to share the route with other users inside the application or via social media
platforms is going to be included.
